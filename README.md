# EvoGame
A simple web game to teach the basic concept of evolution and natural selection

## What’s the goal?

We want to understand how adaptations like camouflage, aposematism and mimicry can establish in a population under the selective pressure of predation 
and identify factors that can be important for this process.

You will play the predator and will have the chance to observe changes in the prey population over generations.


## What to do?

As a predator, you must survive each round by feeding on enough prey. 

Click on insects like these to get your nutrients. 

After each feeding round that you survive, remaining prey will reproduce, replenishing the insect population. You will have the chance to feed again on the new generation for a maximum of 10 rounds.

Let’s see if you survive until the end!
